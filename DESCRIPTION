Description: Imputing blockwise missing data by imprecise imputation,
    featuring a domain-based, variable-wise, and case-wise strategy. 
    Furthermore, the estimation of lower and upper bounds for 
    unconditional and conditional probabilities based on the obtained
    imprecise data is implemented.
    Additionally, two utility functions are supplied: one to check 
    whether variables in a data set contain set-valued observations;
    and another to merge two already imprecisely imputed data. 
    The method is described in a technical report by Endres, Fink and
    Augustin (2018, <doi:10.5282/ubm/epub.42423>).
